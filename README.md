# Computer Organization and Architecture Lab - Assembly Code Repository
This repository contains all the code developed during the lab sessions, organized according to weeks, for the assembly language module.
## Overview
In this lab, we delve into the fundamentals of computer organization and architecture through the lens of assembly language programming. Each week's code corresponds to the topics covered in the lab sessions and serves as a practical guide to understanding low-level programming concepts.
## Structure
The repository is structured into weekly folders, each containing the code developed during that particular week's lab session. Here's an overview of the folder structure:
* Week_1: Arithmetic and Conditional Op[erations
## Getting Started
To get started with exploring the code, simply navigate to the respective week's folder of interest. You can review the code files directly on GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine for a more in-depth analysis.
